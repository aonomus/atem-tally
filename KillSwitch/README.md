#Arduino based ATEM kill switch using Uno + Ethernet

This is for having an emergency kill switch for an ATEM that will dump
both the program and preview source to a pre-defined source if the button
is hit.  The reason it sets both program and preview is so that there 
needs to be manual intervention to bring the feed back online.

Planned Changes in Fork
> - Edit for Arduino Nano + Arduino Nano Ethernet shield (W5100 chipset)
> - Illuminated pushbutton LED feedback
